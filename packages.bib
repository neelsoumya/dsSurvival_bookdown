@article{Banerjee2022,
abstract = {Achieving sufficient statistical power in a survival analysis usually requires large amounts of data from different sites. Sensitivity of individual-level data, ethical and practical considerations regarding data sharing across institutions could be a potential challenge for achieving this added power. Hence we implemented a federated meta-analysis approach of survival models in DataSHIELD, where only anonymous aggregated data are shared across institutions, while simultaneously allowing for exploratory, interactive modelling. In this case, meta-analysis techniques to combine analysis results from each site are a solution, but a manual analysis workflow hinders exploration. Thus, the aim is to provide a framework for performing meta-analysis of Cox regression models across institutions without manual analysis steps for the data providers. We introduce a package (dsSurvival) which allows privacy preserving meta-analysis of survival models, including the calculation of hazard ratios. Our tool can be of great use in biomedical research where there is a need for building survival models and there are privacy concerns about sharing data. A tutorial in bookdown format with code, diagnostics, plots and synthetic data is available here: https://neelsoumya.github.io/dsSurvivalbookdown/ All code is available from the following repositories: https://github.com/neelsoumya/dsSurvivalClient/ https://github.com/neelsoumya/dsSurvival/ {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},
